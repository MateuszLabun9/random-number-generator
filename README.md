# random-number-generator
Java project on programming in JAVA subject. This application takes two intervals and generate random numbers based on those conditions. 

Firstly user has to provide interval of numbers, this should be two numbers e.g. 4,20, values have to be possitive.
After that information about probabilities is needed. User has to provide probabilities from 0 to 100, sum of probabilities have to be equal 100 e.g 20,30,30,20. 
When button "Submit" is pressed, program will generate 1000 numbers from provided interval with given probabilities.
On screen will be displayed a bar graph with random generated values and amount of times they were generated.
