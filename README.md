When button "Submit" is pressed, program will generate 1000 numbers from provided interval with given probabilities.
On screen will be displayed a bar graph with random generated values and amount of times they were generated. 
Additionaly, every user imput is checked if values are provided correctly, every time button submit is pressed, both inputs are validated.
